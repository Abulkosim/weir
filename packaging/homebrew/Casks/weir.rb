  caveats <<~EOS
    Weir is not notarized, so macOS blocks the first launch.
    Open System Settings → Privacy & Security, click Open Anyway, then Open.
    On macOS 12–14, Control-click Weir in Applications → Open also works.
    The weir command (weir --json, weir test) works once Weir has opened.
